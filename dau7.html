            <h2>My travel experience</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on August 07, 2023 by Ashlesha Gautam</em></p>
            
            <p>Ten years ago, if you told me that I would be a travel blogger at this point in my life, I would have called you crazy!! And here I am.</p>
           <p>What started out as a little travel blog to keep friends and family up-to-date on our around the world trip has grown into something much bigger. This unexpected journey has been a life changing experience, not only for me, but also for my friends.</p> <ul>
                <p>Follow these 4 travel safety tips to help you take a trip that’s memorable for all the right reasons.</p>

            <ul><li><strong>Do your research</strong>:Get to know your destination in depth before you arrive. Read traveler reviews and consult with locals for information about the safest neighborhoods, places to stay and incidences of crime.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t draw attention</strong>: People who look like they’re from out of town are especially vulnerable to crime, so try to blend in as much as you can. Choose inconspicuous clothing that won't attract attention. Be discreet when looking at maps and approach people carefully if you need to ask for directions.</li>
                <li><strong>Make copies of important documents</strong>:You never know when you might need a copy of your passport, driver’s license or another form of identification. Scan these documents to save online and print out several hard copies. That way, you won’t be scrambling to find proper documentation if you need to get home</li>
                <li><strong>Keep your friends and family updated</strong>:No matter whether you’re going, on an overnight jaunt or a month-long international journey, it’s always a good idea to let friends or family back home know. Before you leave, send a copy of your itinerary to a few trusted people who can keep tabs on your whereabouts. Check in regularly with your contacts so they know you’re where you’re supposed to be. </li>
